# For your homework, you'll need to create a Banking class that does the following:
# Tracks an initial account balance
# Tracks deposits in the account
# Tracks withdrawals to the account
# Prints out a current balance
# Prints an error message if someone tries to withdraw more money than what is currently in the account
# Upload your python script to Canvas.

# Stretch goals:
# Create a script that imports the Banking class and instantiates two users with balances.
# Update the script to have the users withdraw from their bank account
# Update the script to have the users deposit to their account
# Print the user's balance.
